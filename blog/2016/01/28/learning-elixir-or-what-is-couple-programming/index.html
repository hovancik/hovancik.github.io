    <p>I'll have to admit that I pretty much don't remember why, but few days ago my<br />
girlfriend and I decided to start to learn <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir programming language</a> together.</p>

<p>Probably because I've tried to do that alone some time ago, but I gave up after<br />
quite short time. I didn't manage to force my self to keep learning and after<br />
a while I was <em>forgetting</em> more that I was <em>learning</em>.</p>

<p>You see, learning something new is always a good thing, but one needs a motivation to keep up. And what's better motivation than learning with someone else? Someone you have near you all the time?</p>

<p>That would be my girlfriend, right? I am software developer, she is not, this should be fun!</p>

<h3 id="the-plan">The plan.</h3>

<p>The plan is rather simple. We bought <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir">Elixir book</a> and slowly we are going to read it.</p>

<p>She is not a software developer so we should both learn a lot. She, because she is doing something totally new, and me, because when trying to explain to her, I will need to look up a lot of stuff. At least I think so. I mean I'm pretty sure there's a lot of things I can not explain because my understanding of them is very tiny.</p>

<h3 id="so">So.</h3>

<p>So I will be writing here. She will be writing as well. There <a href="http://ontheshelf.github.io/">On the shelf</a>. I hope you are going there right now and will make some comments.</p>

<p>Part of learning is <em>making mistakes</em> and that's where you can help us.</p>
