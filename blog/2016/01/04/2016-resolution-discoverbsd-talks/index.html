<p>Do you make resolutions for New Year? <strong>I don't.</strong></p>

<p>Except this year. Or last year. Depending when do you consider "when".</p>

<p>Anyway, usually I don't, because I think they never work, it's stupid, andâ€¦  <br />
And there's not a thing I wanna change right then, usually. Because if I wanna<br />
change something, I'm just gonna change it whenever it comes to my mind.<br />
No need to wait till the end of a year.</p>

<p><em>Usually.</em></p>

<p>So basically, the fact that I have one for 2016, is just good timing:<br />
It was during christmas break and I wanted to make something<br />
for my blog at <a href="https://discoverbsd.com">DiscoverBSD</a>.</p>

<h3 id="discoverbsd-talks"><a href="https://talks.discoverbsd.com">DiscoverBSD Talks</a>.</h3>

<p>When I started the <a href="https://discoverbsd.com">blog</a>, idea was to learn more of<br />
BSDs. I've kinda learnt a lot, but I guess, one can always learn more.<br />
Like getting some books, going to conferences, attend meet-ups,<br />
online stuff, etc..</p>

<p>Conferences are right now expensive for me, so I wanted another way to be<br />
able to see what's up.</p>

<h3 id="and-luckily-a-lot-of-talks-can-be-found-online">And luckily, a lot of talks can be found online.</h3>

<p>Good for me right?</p>

<p>So right now the resolution is to watch one BSD-related conference<br />
(or not from conference) talk every 2 weeks. And for that reason I am building<br />
<a href="https://talks.discoverbsd.com">DiscoverBSD Talks</a> website.<br />
Sources are on <a href="https://github.com/DiscoverBSD/Talks">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Because, you know, it makes it easier for me to keep the resolution. I mean<br />
I needed to build it, it's like my child and shit. And if some people join me, awesome.</p>

<h3 id="because-i-cant-do-this-alone">Because I can't do this alone.</h3>

<p>Right now I hope it will become a community based website where<br />
people can watch and discuss videos, and thus <em>learn</em>.</p>

<p>I plan to release new video every two weeks. To join me, you might want<br />
to subscribe to get notified when new video is released<br />
(via <a href="http://eepurl.com/bHOOKz">email</a> or<br />
<a href="https://talks.discoverbsd.com/feed.xml">rss</a>).</p>

<h3 id="and-please-comment-on-videos">And please comment on videos</h3>

<p>So we can all learn together. I am pretty sure that everyone will catch some different important detail.</p>

<h3 id="first-video-is-already-out-and-you-can-learn-some-interesting-stuff"><a href="https://talks.discoverbsd.com/2016/01/01/early-days-of-unix-and-design-of-sh.html">First video</a> is already out and you can learn some interesting stuff.</h3>

<p>Like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seventh edition #Unix release management: Utility owned by last person who touched it</li>
  <li>There were 40 system calls in Sixth edition #Unix 1975</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Go <a href="https://talks.discoverbsd.com/2016/01/01/early-days-of-unix-and-design-of-sh.html">watch</a> to learn more!</strong></p>
