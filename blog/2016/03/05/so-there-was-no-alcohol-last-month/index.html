    <h2 id="and-sweets-as-well">And sweets as well.</h2>

<p>And it was interesting, indeed. I did keep the promise and during February (<em>the shortest month, right?</em>) there was no alcohol and sweets for me.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-i-expect">What did I expect?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spend less money</li>
  <li>loose weight</li>
  <li>feel better overall</li>
  <li>sleep better</li>
  <li>have <strong>worse social life</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And stuff like that.</p>

<h3 id="what-was-the-reality">What was the reality?</h3>

<p>Some things are obvious: I did spend less money. Same goes with other stuff: I slept better, I was not tired during workdays (before, I usually had to eat some sweet stuff afternoon, my body demanded it.). Eat more fruits!</p>

<h4 id="weight">Weight.</h4>
<p>I went down to <strong>67kg from 71kg</strong>. Nice.</p>

<p>It's also because there were Christmas not that long ago, but anyway, it makes me happy. Loosing some weight was something that I wanted. And I was not changing any of my eating habits, except sugar. I might even ate more fast food than usually.</p>

<h4 id="alcohol">Alcohol.</h4>

<p>I thought that this might be hard, but in the end, it wasn't. I still did not drink anything, yet. Didn't really had taste for beer or so.</p>

<p>Kinda strange.</p>

<h4 id="so">So.</h4>

<p>So social life: was OK, not that awkward. There were not that much parties, I was doing other stuff instead. Might see less people.</p>

<h3 id="next">Next?</h3>

<p>This experiment was great. Hopefully I will do more of this stuff in future. Like take a walk everyday, exercise in the morning and evening.. and soâ€¦</p>
