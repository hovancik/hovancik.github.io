    <h1 id="or--i-dont-really-know">Or â€¦ I don't really know.</h1>

<p>So there are many ways how to live our life. And by ways I mean <em>philosophy</em> behind it. Or however you call it. You probably have one: religion, maybe regular law or some another set of (moral) rules.</p>

<h2 id="nah-i-dont-wanna-talk-about-how-you-found-yours">Nah, I don't wanna talk about how you found yours.</h2>
<p>I wanna interest you to try something new. <a href="http://modernstoicism.com/">Stoicism</a>. The Stoic Week 2015 started today, but anyway, you might still join.</p>

<h2 id="so-day-one">So day One</h2>

<p>I hadn't had time to get me a notebook, so I'll be writing my diary here.</p>

<p>Well, I was rather short on time, so not so much to report here: I read the handbook (no in great detail, rather fast reading) and I did my morning and midday meditations. I am about to do my evening one.</p>

<p>First I have to say, that I do not agree with some basic stuff in there: I don't wanna be best possible person and useful for society. I don't seem to see any reason for it. But I admit I should've read the handbook more carefully, I might not be getting the point right.</p>

<p>I did them both in train, so it was rather reading the text, not so much thinking. I guess I could be thinking about how I could respond when people ask me for help in train (with luggage). That didn't come to my mind during morning meditation.</p>

<p>I will need to read guidebook again, they also have some audio files. Hopefully tomorrow morning, 12 hours of travel kind of killed me.</p>

<h2 id="but">But</h2>
<p>But I really believe this exercise will be good for me. I'm about to find out how during this week.</p>
