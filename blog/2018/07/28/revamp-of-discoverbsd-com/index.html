    <p>It's been a long time since 2013, when I first started blogging at DiscoverBSD.com, motivation being to learn more about BSD family of operating systems.</p>

<p>Years has passed and I haven't had a time to keep doing it, so recently I have decided that it's time to do something about it.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-the-new-discoverbsd">Welcome to the new DiscoverBSD</h2>

<p>Let's keep this short and sweet, so here is what's changing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blog that was at <a href="https://discoverbsd.com">https://discoverbsd.com</a> is moving to <a href="https://discoverbsd.blogspot.com">https://discoverbsd.blogspot.com</a> (was not able to make blog.discoverbsd.com with blogger)</li>
  <li><a href="https://discoverbsd.com">https://discoverbsd.com</a> is becoming <em>The BSD community linklog</em>, the new app that I built</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/_DiscoverBSD">Twitter</a> posts will be tweeted automatically by new app</li>
  <li>newsletter that was associated with old blog is paused</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-non-required-reading">What does it mean? (Non-required reading)</h3>

<p>First of all, there will be bunch of new dead-links over internet (old DiscoverBSD links). Content of posts will still be available on new blog location, and 404 page of new DiscoverBSD will have mention of it.</p>

<p>Secondly, let's go check the new <a href="https://discoverbsd.com">DiscoverBSD</a> now. It is pretty much self-explanatory.</p>

<p><strong>My hope is that new DiscoverBSD will become place where people come to look for interesting BSD-related articles.</strong></p>

<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>anyone can authenticate via Twitter and add link to the interesting article, tutorial, whatever</li>
  <li>admin will check the link and can approve or deny it</li>
  <li>approved article will appear on page and will be automatically tweeted</li>
  <li>we will all be happy to find interesting content</li>
</ul>

<p>The application itself is open-source and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/DiscoverBSD/DiscoverBSD">Github</a>. In the beginning, I will be administrating the content by myself, so it might take few hours until the content is approved.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-help">You can help</h3>

<p>I am looking for someone who can help me with TOS and Privacy Policy. I've created some, but I am not a lawyer.</p>

<p>Also help with creating logo would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>You can become a patron on <a href="https://patreon.com/hovancik">Patreon</a> and support my efforts.</p>

<p>I am also looking for hosting company that can host Ruby on Rails app and have BSD hosting, in exchange for a bit of an ad on DiscoverBSD. Ask your BSD-hosting provider to help.</p>

<p>And the most of all, <strong>please submit awesome BSD content</strong> that you have found!</p>

<p>I'll see you there â€¦</p>
