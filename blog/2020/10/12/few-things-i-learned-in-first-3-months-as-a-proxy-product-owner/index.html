    <p><em>Three months ago I started to work as a Proxy Product Owner (Proxy PO), so I thought it might be interesting to reflect on it and maybe write a thing or two about it, for the benefit of other people starting in a similar role or me coming back later.</em></p>

<h3 id="so-whats-a-proxy-po">So what's a Proxy PO?</h3>

<p>If you want a specific definition, you can find a couple of them onlineâ€¦  But, for context of this article, <strong>Proxy PO is a member of an agile team, with a subset of responsibilities and powers of a PO</strong>. PO should still be part of the team, so one might use this role when PO can not fully concentrate on a product (eg. she has multiple ones), is not co-located with the rest of a team, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="1">1.</h3>

<p>When I started to search for a PM/PO job about a half year ago, I didn't even know that such a role existed. When I looked up a definition, the consensus (= few articles I read, so I might be totally off) seemed to be that it's not really a good role to be in, because you hardly have real ownership and people might look at you as an assistant/secretary to the PO.</p>

<p>After 3 months I can tell that that's not true: <strong>Whether you're PO, PM, Proxy PO, or developer; how much ownership over a product you can yield only depends on the amount you're willing to take and to demand.</strong></p>

<p>You might not always be as successful in getting it as you would like to, but, more often then not, it's just a question of time. Why would you get hired otherwise?</p>

<h3 id="2">2.</h3>

<p>That leads to the second point: <strong>Trust required for ownership is not an easy thing to get.</strong> But don't worry, you can help yourself by doing what you're already good at.</p>

<h3 id="3">3.</h3>

<p>And that's figuring out <em>people</em>'s needs. I am not <em>not using</em> word <em>customer</em> by accident, because by <em>people</em> I mean your stakeholders, PO, testers; basically everyone. <strong>Treat your organization and your team as you would a customer: understand their problems and then prioritize solving them.</strong> In most cases, this will move the product forward as well.</p>

<p>A word of warning, though: Make sure people want your help.</p>

<h3 id="4">4.</h3>

<p><strong>Start at an interview.</strong> That's the one trick I can't recommend enough:  try to figure out what kind of problems they are looking to solve with the role, then ask yourself whether that's interesting for you.</p>

<h3 id="5">5.</h3>

<p>Being "only" a Proxy might be even good for you. <strong>It's always easier to assert ownership over time than trying to hold on to it from day one.</strong> Being Proxy also gives you more freedom to pick up stuff you're more comfortable with.</p>

<h3 id="summa-summarum">Summa summarum</h3>

<p>Summa summarum, I am pretty happy with the last three months. If you see such a role being advertised, it's definitely worth interviewing.</p>
