Hi everyone,

I am really happy to announce, that **version 1.12 of [*Stretchly*](/stretchly) is here!** You can download it from [downloads](/stretchly/downloads) page.

Thanks to everyone for their [support](/stretchly/sponsor)!

### Added
- support for Flatpak (as of writing, still needs to be processed)

### Changed
- updated many translations
- remaining times are more exact
- only update tray when needed

### Removed
- no Linux ARM32 builds, as CI does not support them anymore
