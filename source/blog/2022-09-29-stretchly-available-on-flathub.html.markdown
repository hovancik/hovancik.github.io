Hi all, 

I'm really happy to announce that Stretchly can now be installed from [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.hovancik.Stretchly), with `flatpak install flathub net.hovancik.Stretchly` command. 

This feature was brought to you by community member [Jordan Williams](https://github.com/jwillikers). Many thanks!
