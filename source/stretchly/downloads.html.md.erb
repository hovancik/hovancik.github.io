## Downloads [![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/hovancik/stretchly/total)](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases) [![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/stretchly.svg)](https://repology.org/project/stretchly/versions)

The latest official **installers** and **portable versions** for macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD can be found at [Github Releases](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases) page.

Following sections link some individual files for a simplicity.

### macOS

Download the [DMG file](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases/download/v1.10.0/Stretchly-1.10.0.dmg).

You can also install *Stretchly* with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `brew update && brew install --cask stretchly`. When upgrading, run `brew update && brew upgrade --cask`. Don't forget to Quit Stretchly, first.

*Stretchly* is not signed (due to its costs) so you will need to use this workaround for the first run: [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).

If you're using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) on macOS you can use this [Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/KingOfSpades/stretchFred) to interact with Stretchly.

### Windows

Download the [installer](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases/download/v1.10.0/Stretchly.Setup.1.10.0.exe).

You can also install *Stretchly* with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) by running the following command from the command line or from PowerShell: `choco install stretchly`. Upgrade with `choco upgrade stretchly`.

Stretchly is also available in Microsoft's [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).

You can install *Stretchly* for all users silently by running this as administrator: `installer.exe /S /allusers`.

### Linux/BSD/Portable

For portable versions and for Linux/BSD installers, head to [Github Releases](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases) page. The most widely used distributions should be covered.

#### Linux note

Please see [https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/tray) for Electron's Tray Linux specifics. Having `libappindicator1` installed should be enough for *Stretchly*.

For Natural breaks, you might need some packages too (`libxss-dev`).

If *Stretchly* is not starting, you might need to run `sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`. Read more [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972). Depending on your distro, you probably want to do something similar to this, so the settings are kept after reboot: Add `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1` to `/etc/sysctl.d/00-local-userns.conf` and reboot.

### Running from source

To run *Stretchly* from source you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), ideally the one specified in `package.json`. Clone the repo, run `npm install` and then simply run `npm start` to start *Stretchly*.

### Custom installer

You can create a custom installer by running `npm run pack` or `npm run dist` after `npm install --no-save`.
