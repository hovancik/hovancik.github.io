<h2>Lead Analyst / Product Manager</h2>
<h3>Box+Dice, Prague (Czechia), Aug 2018 – Dec 2019</h3>
<p>
  <i>Box+Dice is a real estate property transaction platform and CRM serving
    almost 1000 offices and over 14 000 users in Australia and New Zealand.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Working in Product for the Australian company, I started with the opportunity to redesign
  mobile app to solve the UX issues, introduce new features and migrate the majority
  of users to the latest version. After its succes, I also led a project
  to align web app and branding across the company based on the mobile app's design.
  One of the challenges of this role was working with a team scattered around the globe.
  Therefore, beside product development, I also prioritized and allocated work
  for the team of developers, UX and testers, while helping them to understand what
  problems we were solving. I enjoyed communication with third parties
  and finding a way how to best fulfill their wishes while
  respecting the needs of our customers and business.
